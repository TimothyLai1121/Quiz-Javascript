# HTML # 
On this project, I will include 3 HTML files.
* index.html[^1]
* game.html[^2]
* end.html[^3]

[^1]: index.html will present a play button and direct to game.html.
[^2]: game.html will be where player will have 90 seconds to complete the quiz before getting alert for time's up!
[^3]: end.html will have four buttons for user to either submit score, play again, main page, and visiting creator portfolio.

# CSS #
My favorite part of web development. Colors

* I had included a font from Google Fonts
* Picked out a color pallete and turned it into variable for easier mark up.

# JavaScript #
![jsgifs](./assets/readme-gifs/js-snippet.png)

Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the quiz [^1], including starting the timer, presenting the questions, and handling user input.
* Add an event listener to the start button that will start the timer and present the first question when clicked.
* Create a function that presents the next question after the user has answered the previous one.
* Create a function that subtracts time from the timer when the user answers a question incorrectly.
* Create a function that ends the game when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.
* Create a function that allows the user to save their initials and score after the game is over.


[^1]You should use JavaScript to hide and show questions and answers, handle user input, update the timer and validate if the answer is correct.
